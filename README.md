## School Projects

### CS321 BTree project
This was by far my biggest project that I have worked on. This was a group project for my Data Structures class where myself and two others worked together. We utilised GitHub for the first time in this project, used agile development to meet sprint deadlines using a scrum board with project backlogs and sprint backlogs, and implemented mySQL into this project. It took us over a month to finish this project including multiple 8 hour days working over Thanksgiving break to make progress. We had weekly standup meetings to discuss our progress. Our team worked extremely well together as we were able to help each other with parts of the project the other two didn't understand. I primarily worked on the BTree part of the project and helped my teammates with parts they were stuck on and they helped me on parts I didn't understand so everything made sense to everyone.
